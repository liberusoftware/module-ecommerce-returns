/**
 * Money as an integer count of the currency's smallest unit, and the one
 * conversion this module is allowed to perform.
 *
 * **Restated here rather than imported.** This package requires no sibling
 * commerce package at all, so a shared money helper would be a shared dependency,
 * and the whole boundary rule is that there is not one. Forty lines duplicated is
 * the price of a module that installs alone, and it is a price worth paying twice
 * over for a package whose job is refund amounts.
 *
 * **Parsing is string arithmetic, not multiplication.** `(int) (19.99 * 100)` is
 * `1998`, because `19.99` is not representable in binary floating point and the
 * cast truncates what is left. Splitting on the point, padding the fraction to the
 * currency's exponent and concatenating cannot lose a penny, because no float is
 * ever constructed. `MoneyTest` pins `19.99 → 1999` with the float result written
 * next to it, so the reason survives the person who found it — and it is the test
 * `docs/adoption.md` points at, because the host's `refunds.amount` is
 * `decimal(10,2)` and converting it is exactly this conversion at scale.
 *
 * A value more precise than the currency is **refused**, not rounded.
